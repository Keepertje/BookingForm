First made two fields with validation
not having made a reactive angular2 form before I used
//Never made a model driven form before so I started with http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/06/22/model-driven-forms-in-angular-2.html

Styling:
css to use variables like color and font

html:
first made basic structure,
div for header, body and footer and put in the text. 
add the colours and the button. 

added the scss so it looks like the pdf.
