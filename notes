First makeit work: just make two fields with validation
not having made a reactive angular2 form before I used
//with http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/06/22/model-driven-forms-in-angular-2.html

Styling:
scss to use variables like color and font

html:
first made basic structure,
div for header, body and footer and put in the text. 
add the colours and the button. 

added the scss so it looks like the pdf. using vw and vh and % so it will already be responsive
(desktop version)
For last part mobile I use mediaqueries (not showing the border;)


Fixed the karma test (it is working)
Fixed the e2e test, to make sure invalid shows when field is invalid



When submit and the bookingcode is good -> show the mockdata
-> make router, and make sure it works
-> show the data
-> add a bit of styling and structure instead of showing the plain data.
-> check if the bookingcode was even correct
-> check if the bookingcode and familyname match.
