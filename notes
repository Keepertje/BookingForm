I use angular-cli, for the short timespan I don't want to be bothered with setting up the project and the build process.

Then I set up a git repo to make sure I don;t loose any working stuff in the process.

First thing I did was what was necessary: make two fields with validation.
I never made a reactive angular2 form before so I used 
 http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/06/22/model-driven-forms-in-angular-2.html
to get started.
I used a regex as Validator to capture all the validations in one go. 


Then I made the basic structure in html based on the screenshots. A header for the check-in part and a body
for the actual form. I also added the text and button.

Then I started on the styling, I decided to use sass. Because the colors are used on multiple places I can then declare them
as variables. Also I have worked with css and less but not with sass before so I thought this was a good idea to try it out.
I used vw, vh and % as much as possible already to make it responsive. For the last bit of responsiveness I used a media query (not showing the border).

I then made the karma test, after that I worked on the e2e test to make sure 'invalid' is shown when the fields are invalid.
I define the possible inputs at the top of the e2e file, if they (the validation rules) change you can change them in one place and not everywhere in the tests.

Then I started on the mockdata. I created a service with angular-cli to get the mockdata and added it to the onSubmit in the component to actually gather it.
After that I tried to make the karma test for the service working, but I got stuck on that typescript wants the response to be void(). 



Lessons learned:
-Angular2 changed a lot since I used it for the last time (beginning of 2016). Searching is hard since 80% is deprecated / changed /not used / angular1 
-The validations need to be customized so the error messages can be customized as well and the user knows better what went wrong.
